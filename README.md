## **Subnautica Autosave by Dingo**

#### **Description:**  
An automated save system which saves in time intervals. The autosave slots are separate from the normal save by default, but can be configured otherwise.  
You can define several custom parameters in the settings file (see the Configuration section).

#### **Installation:**  
1) Install [QMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/201)﻿ if you haven't already  
2) Download the zip file from the [Files tab](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/237/?tab=files)  
3) Unzip the contents of the zip to the game's main directory (where Subnautica.exe can be found)  

#### **(Optional) Configuration:**  
1) Navigate to the mod's directory (*Subnautica\QMods\SubnauticaAutosave*).  
2) Edit settings.json with Notepad or your favourite text editor.  
3) Define custom values according to your preference. The settings available are -  
   *  "SecondsBetweenAutosaves": 900 -- The time (in seconds) between autosave attempts. Must be at least 120.  
   *  "MaxSaveFiles": 3  -- The maximum amount of autosave slots. Must be at least 1.  
   *  "MinimumPlayerHealthPercent": 25 -- If player health is below this percent, no save will occur. Change to 0 to disable this option.  
   *  "HardcoreMode": false -- If true, autosaves will override the normal save slot instead of using separate slots.  

#### **(Optional) Translation:**  
If you want to contribute a translation for this mod, please follow these steps:  
1) Look at the file *"English.json"* in *QMods\SubnauticaAutosave\Languages*  
2) Copy that file and change the file name to your language. It needs to match the file name in *Subnautica\SNUnmanagedData\LanguageFiles*  
3) Translate the file. Do not touch the keys ("AutosaveStarting"), only the translated values ("Autosave sequence...")  
4) Share the file with me, preferrably over GitHub, a Nexus private message or (if you must) a comment  

#### **(Optional) Building:**
If you want to build from source you may use the following Environmental variables:
* **SUBNAUTICA_PATH** - 
The path to your Subnautica install directory where msbuild can find its dependencies, this will default to "```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica```".
* **DEBUG_OUTPUT_PATH** - 
The path to Subnautica QMods\SubnauticaAutosave directory, this will default to "```$(SUBNAUTICA_PATH)\QMods\SubnauticaAutosave```" so you can fire up Subnautica and debug the mod in-game.
* **RELEASE_OUTPUT_PATH** - 
The path to your intended release distribution directory, this will default to "```..\QMods\SubnauticaAutosave```" ending up in this repository. These files will be copied to the DEBUG_OUTPUT_PATH during a release build so you can verify the build before you publish anything.

Example build command:

```dotnet msbuild -p:Platform=AnyCPU -p:Configuration=Release -p:SUBNAUTICA_PATH="D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Subnautica"```

#### **FAQ:**  
* **Q. Is this mod safe to add or remove from an existing save file?**
* A. Perfectly safe.
* **Q. Does this mod have any known conflicts?**
* A. I don't think so, but I would not use this mod with [Safe Autosave](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/94) due to redundancy.
* **Q. Does this mod impact performance?**
* A. Autosaves are stored using the same code as regular saves. Gameplay will "freeze" for a few seconds when saving and then continue normally.
